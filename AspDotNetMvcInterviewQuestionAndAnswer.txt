#######   ====== Interview Question And Answer in Asp.Net Mvc (Start) ============######

1. What Is Asp.Net Mvc And Advantage.
Answer ==> What(Asp.Net Mvc) {Framework, software design pattern, Application devide three architecture(MVC)}.

Advantage ==> [{Reach early for any Module find error, easy to understand of structure pattern, Project more systematic}]

2 ==> Razor View Engine
  what(Markup sysntax)
  Helps write (Html + Server side code(c#)).
  
  
3 ==> Routing & Ites type
    type ==> (two type 1. {Conventional Roting, Attribute Routing}).
    what ==> (Pattern matching System, Page Navigation Technique)
    work ==> (which controller action method call decided by routing, IT responsible browser request controller action).
	
4. 	What is difference between viewbag And ViewData and Tempdata.

 ViewBag (What)==>(state management, way, {controller to view data transfer (Current request)}).
	        (work) ==>(data transfer controller to view using {Properties}, run time declaration or dynamic properties).
			 
 ViewData, (what) ==> (state management, way, {controller to view data transfer (Current request)}).	
              (work) ==>(data transfer controller to view using {Key}, compile time declaration). 	

 Tempdata (what) ==> (state management, way, {controller to view data transfer (current request or Other action request)}).
          (work) ==>(data transfer controller to view using {Key}).
		  
 
5. What is The Partial View
   What ==>(Partial view in ASP.NET MVC is a special view that renders a portion of view content.)
   
6. What is the MVC Life Cycle.
   Answer: Application_Start() ==> Routing ==> MVC HANDLER ==> IControllerFactory.CreateController ==>
   CreateTempDataProvider ==> CreateActionInvoker ==> Authentication Filter ==> Authorization Filter ==>
   Model Binder ==> Action and Action Filter ==> Execute Result And Execute Filter ==> Controller Dispose.
   
   
7. What is difference between VAR And Dynamic keyword.
Answer ==> Var (value type, intelisence show, all type value accept, initilization value is required);
           Dynamic (Reference type, not intelisence show, not initilization value is required);
		   
		   
8. IEnumrable VS IQueryable.	
  
  Every Collection Class implements 3 Interface ==> IEnumrable, ICollection, IList OR IDictionary.
  IList<T> ==> Generic classes.
  IList ==> Non-Generic class.
  
  IEnumrable == What ==> (Interface)
              Use ==> (Iterate for collection classes using Foreach loop).  
			  
			  
  IQueryable == What==> (Interface)
                Use ==> (Iterate for collection classes using Foreach loop).

Difference Between IEnumrable vs IQueryable ==> {IQueryable is child of IEnumrable, In Memory collection [IEnumrable], Out Memory Collection [IQueryable]}.

				
    


#######   ====== Interview Question And Answer in Asp.Net Mvc (End) ============######


C## Interview question And Answer.

Delegates ==> what(delegate is a type safe function pointer)
              Work(It is a hold of function reference).

          The class who raises events is called Publisher (Only One Publisher),

                    OR
		  In C#, an event is an encapsulated delegate. 
		  It is dependent on the delegate.
