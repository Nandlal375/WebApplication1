======What is the State Management=============

State Management Definition ==> State management is a process of maintaining the state of values between multiple request of the page(s).
 => when make the statefull web Application then required state management technique.
 
=> State management is The two type 
   
   1. Client Side State management Technique
     
     1.1 =>Cookies. 
     1.2 =>ViewState.     
     1.3 =>HiddenField.
     1.4 =>QueryString.
     1.5 =>Control State
     
   2. Server Side State Management

     2.1 => Session State 
     2.2 => Application State  AS {Application["Name"] = lblname.Text}



====== Page Navigation Technique======

 1. HyperLink Control
 2. Response.Write()
 3. Responde.redirect()
 4. Server.Transfer()
 5. Server.Execute()
 6. Cross-Page postback
 7. Window.Open()



Caching ==> Caching enables you to store data in memory for rapid access. As like {[<%@ OutputCache Duration="30" VaryByParam="None" %>]}

Mostly, there are 3 types of caching. ==> 
                                        1. Output Caching
										2. Data Caching
										3. Fragment Caching 

## Fragment Caching ==> Fragmentation Catching is used for some portion of the page to be cached and we can do Fragmentation Caching using a User Control.

## Data Caching ==> Data Caching is basically used for reducing database contention and round-trips, in other words by using Data Caching we store required data in a cache 
                    so the Web Server does not send a request to the database for every request so that the database performance will also increased. 
                    The data cached is a Full-Featured Cache Engine that enables you to store and retrieve data between multiple HTTP requests 
                    and multiple sessions within the same application.


            Example ==> Dataset ds = Getdata()
			            Cache["Productdata"] = ds;
                        griedview1.dataSource = ds;
						griedview1.databind();
						
## Output Cache ==> <%@ OutputCache Duration="30" VaryByParam="None" %>;

## Panel Control ==> The Panel control is used as a container for other controls. 
                     This control is often used to generate controls by code and to display or hide groups of controls as per the condition.
